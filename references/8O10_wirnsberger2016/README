The root directory in which this file is located contains the directories
src and nemd, and the files README, COPYING and INSTALL with additional 
information on copyrights as well as instructions concerning the installation 
of LAMMPS with the updated source files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

src
===
 
   This directory contains six modified/new C++ source and header files which 
   are to be compiled with the 9Dec14 version of LAMMPS in order to provide 
   some additional functionality, and an updated makefile.

   -> fix_ehex.cpp 

      This file contains the new eHEX/a algorithm.

   -> fix_ehex.h  
   
      This file is the header file for fix_ehex.cpp.

   -> fix_rattle.cpp 

      This file contains the RATTLE algorithm, whose functionality is 
      used by the eHEX/a algorithm in order to update the constraining forces 
      after applying the coordinate correction.

   -> fix_rattle.h

      This file is the header file for fix_rattle.cpp.

   -> fix_shake.cpp

      We had to modify fix shake as well for compatibility, because the class
      FixRattle inherits from FixShake.

   -> fix_shake.h 

      This file is the header file for fix_shake.cpp.

   -> Makefile.mpi

      This is an updated makefile for the compilation of the
      parallel version of LAMMPS. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

nemd
====

   This directory contains the following three files:

     -> in.spce
         
        This file is a LAMMPS input script for the production run which generates
	the full NEMD trajectory, as well as several other output files.
        This script can be used for both Ewald summation and the Wolf method (see comments in the file).

     -> data.ness_ewald

        This file contains a steady-state configuration of 4500 SPC/E molecules.
	Ewald summation was used for the equilibration.

     -> data.ness_wolf

        In this case the equilibration was carried out with the Wolf method (zeta*L = 7.2, rc = 0.11 nm).
