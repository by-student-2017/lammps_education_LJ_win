 2 ### Molecule type index (i.e. the molecule to observe)
 reorientation ### the type of analysis
 tmax 20000 ### maximum time shift of the time correlation function
 sampling_interval 1 ### every so many timesteps will be used for the tcf
 legendre 1 ### use legendre polynomial of order 2
 charge_arm

 This is an input file for the calculation of a vector reorientational time correlation function.
 To actually perform the implied calculations, it has to be referenced in 'general.inp'.
