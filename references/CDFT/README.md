# Classical density functional theory for in-terfacial properties of hydrogen, helium, deuterium, neon and their mix-tures

There are two directories with multiple files supplied:

- `lammps_inputs`: Input files for LAMMPS simulations for all binary mixtures presented in the main article. Inputs are modified so that they can be used with custom thermodynamic conditions.
- `walkthrough`:
    - `walkthrough.ipynb`: Jupyter-notebook with a detailed description about the workflow from generating LAMMPS table files, setting up the simulation to conducting the DFT computation and comparing results.
    - `in.binary_deuterium_neon`: LAMMPS input file with thermodynamic conditions specified.
    - `*.table`: LAMMPS tables for energy and force calculation. Generated by `walkthrough.ipynb`
    - `deuterium_neon_32K.rdf`: Result of a LAMMPS simulation for the given tables and input file.
    - `walkthrough.html`: Same as Jupyter notebook as static HTML file that can be opened by any browser.
