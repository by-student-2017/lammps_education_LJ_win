 2 ### Molecule type index (i.e. the molecule to observe)
 dihedral 2 ### dihedral autocorrelation + number of dihedral conditions to be fulfilled 
 2 3 4 5    0.0 150.0
 3 4 5 6    0.0 150.0
 tmax 20000 ### maximum time shift of the correlation function
 skip_autocorrelation F  ### compute the autocorrelation function.
 fold T ### also check for the range (360-b) to (360-a), not just a to b
 dump_verbose T ### dump verbose information such as the PES subset population.
 bin_count 100 ### Setting the bin count to 100 (default is 100)
 export 1 ### write the dihedrals for molecule index 1 into separate file.

 This is an input file for the dihedral conditions analysis.
 To actually perform the implied calculations, it has to be referenced in 'general.inp'.
