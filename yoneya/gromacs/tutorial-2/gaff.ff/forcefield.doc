AMBER General Force Field for organic molecules (Version 1.81, May 2017)

; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; This is an improved version of gaff 1.0. We have modified some parameters 
; according to users' feedback. We would like to thank users who provide    
; nice feedback/suggestion, especially David Mobley and Gabriel Rocklin. We 
; are in a process of developing a new generation of general amber force    
; field (gaff2). This version is a meta-version between gaff1 and gaff2.    
; !!!Suggestions/criticisms/comments are always welcome !!!

; Major changes from gaff.dat version 1.0
; 1. All the sp2 carbon in a AR2 ring (such as pyrrole, furan, pyrazole)
; only have cc or cd atom types (no c2). This is suggested by Gabriel
; Rocklin from UCSF. This modification improves the planarity of
; multiple-ring systems
; 2. New van der Waals parameters have been developed for br and i atom
; types. The current parameters can well reproduce the experimental density
; data of CH3Br (1.6755, 20 degree) and CH3I (2.2789, 20 degree): 1.642 for
; CH3Br and 2.25 for CH3I, in contrast, the old parameters give 1.31 and
; 1.84, respectively. (Junmei, unpublished result)
; 3. New van der Waals parameters have been suggested by David Mobley for
; c1, cg and ch atom types. The justification of the changes is discussed at
; http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ct800409d
; 4. We have performed B3LYP/6-31G* optimization for 15 thousands marketed
; or experimental drugs/bio-actives. Reliable bond length and bond angle
; equilibrium parameters were obtained by statistics: each bond length
; parameter must show up in at least five times and has a rmsd smaller than
; 0.02 angstroms; each bond angle parameter must show up at least five times
; and has a rmsd smaller than 2.5 degrees. Those new parameters not showing
; up in old gaff were directly added into gaff 1.x; and some low-quality
; gaff parameters which show up less than five times or have large rmsd
; values (>0.02 angstroms for bond length and >5 degrees for bond angles)
; were replaced with those newly generated. Here are the numbers:
; Bond length: 59 low quality parameters were replaced and 56 new parameters
; were introduced.
; Bond angle:  437 low quality parameters were replaced and 618 new
; parameters were introduced.
